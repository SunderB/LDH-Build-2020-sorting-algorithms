# Coding Sorting Algorithms in Python
## What it does
It's an implementation of 3 different sorting algorithms in Python:
* Bubble sort
* Selection sort
* Insertion sort
It also shows how long each method takes (thanks to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5478351/python-time-measure-function), and also compares it to python's in-built `sorted()` function for fun!

Created during Kunal's [Write Code to Sort a List workshop](https://organize.mlh.io/participants/events/6340-lhd-build-write-code-to-sort-a-list).

## Challenges we ran into
* Python passes copies of arrays to functions instead of a reference to the same array, so I had to copy and return the modified arrays.
* Getting the indexes for the for loops right

## What I learned
* How different sorting methods work
* What the efficiency of different sorting methods is
* About 'big O' notation, and time complexity
* Which methods are used in the real world

## What's next?
* Research and implement more sorting algorithms
* Set up a way of generating random lists and testing all the sorting algorithms
* Program the algorithms in other programming languages (e.g. Ruby)
